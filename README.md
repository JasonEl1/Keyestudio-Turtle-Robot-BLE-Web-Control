# Keyestudio-Turtle-Robot-BLE-Web-Control

Control the Keyestudio Turtle Robot using a web interface. This is accomplished through the use of serial communication from the HM-10 module to the arduino board, and communication through the Web Bluetooth API from the browser to the module.

> The boilerplate code for the JavaScript component of this project was heavily inspired by the following project by ``ErniW`` : [Web-Bluetooth-and-HM-10-module-for-Arduino](https://github.com/ErniW/Web-Bluetooth-and-HM-10-module-for-Arduino)
